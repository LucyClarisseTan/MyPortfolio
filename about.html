                <p><img class="imgleft" src="img/about/about1.png"/>Fanzines or <i>fan magazines</i> are often community driven publications created by people who share particular interests. I have significant experience participating in a few fanzines as a full page artist, small page artist, and project manager. I currently work under the alias of <i>kuurarisu</i>, and have shared multiple pieces of my art online.</p>
            
                <p>As a digital artist and aspiring animator, it is important for me to familiarize myself with the proper design tools and applications. I am capable of using several graphic softwares and video editors including Wondershare Filmora, Adobe Photoshop, After Effects, Premiere Pro, Clip Studio Paint Pro, and Krita.</p>
